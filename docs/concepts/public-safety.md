# Public Safety Rules

This repo is public-safe by design.

Do not commit:
- tenant-specific dataset names
- internal URLs/hostnames
- employee PII (names, emails, IDs)
- screenshots of restricted admin pages
- tokens, keys, or configuration secrets

Preferred:
- generic examples
- redacted samples
- principles (grain, join rules, validation patterns)
- “golden path” report recipes
