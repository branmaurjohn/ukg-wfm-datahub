# Data Scientist Playbook

## What you own
- feature engineering on stable grains
- leakage prevention (as-of discipline)
- backtesting and drift monitoring

## Best practices
- build feature tables from curated, documented sources
- avoid using “future” fields in training windows
- document backfill windows and refresh timing
