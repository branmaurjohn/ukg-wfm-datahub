# Accruals

## What it contains
Balances, transactions, accrual codes, adjustments.

## Why it matters
Accrual issues become payroll issues. Reporting must be consistent and explainable.

## Best practices
- Dashboards: balances (as-of rules documented)
- Investigations: transactions + adjustments
- Be explicit about “as-of date” logic
