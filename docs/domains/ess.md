# ESS / Workflow

## What it contains
Requests and approvals (time off, swaps/covers, status history).

## Why it matters
Workflow analytics exposes bottlenecks: cycle time, approver load, policy friction.

## Best practices
- Use status history, not just current status
- Measure cycle time from created → final decision
