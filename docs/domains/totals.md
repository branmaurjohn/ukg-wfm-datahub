# Totals (Summary Layer)

## What it contains
Pre-aggregated measures used for dashboards (hours, counts, etc.), usually keyed by person/org/date.

## Why it matters
Totals are the safest baseline for KPIs: faster, cheaper, fewer duplication traps.

## Best practices
- Use totals for OT/utilization dashboards
- Drill into detail only when explaining “why”
- Document KPI definitions (what counts, what doesn’t)
